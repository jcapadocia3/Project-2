This is a WORK IN PROGRESS ✨


### User Story:

```
AS SOMEONE that would like to hike in (SPECIFIC AREA),
I WANT to be able to view trails in (SPECIFIC AREA),
SO I CAN find trail-specific information to help me decide where to hike based on elevation, 
the average length of the trail, and fellow hiker’s review of the trail.
```
